                        在将来某时间点之前要完成的动作

这种时态用于描述在将来某个时间点之前将要完成的动作。

## 语法形式

将来完成时的构成是：**主语 + will have + 过去分词**

- **肯定句**：主语 + will have + 过去分词

  - I will have finished.
  - She will have graduated.

- **否定句**：主语 + will not have + 过去分词

  - I will not (won't) have finished.
  - She will not (won't) have graduated.

- **疑问句**：Will + 主语 + have + 过去分词？
  - Will you have finished?
  - Will she have graduated?

## 应用场景

### 1. 将来某时已完成的动作

用于描述在将来某个时间点之前已经完成的动作。

**示例：**

- By next month, I will have finished my thesis. (到下个月，我将已经完成论文。)
- By the time you arrive, I will have cleaned the house. (在你到达之前，我将已经打扫好房子。)

### 2. 表示持续到将来的动作

用于描述到将来某个时间点为止已经持续了多长时间的动作。

**示例：**

- By the end of this month, they will have been married for 25 years. (到本月底，他们将已经结婚25年了。)

- The plane will have landed by now. (飞机现在应该已经降落了。)
- By the time we get there, the movie will have started. (等我们到那里时，电影应该已经开始了。)

## 与其他时态的对比

### 将来完成时 vs 一般将来时

将来完成时强调动作在将来某个时间点之前的完成状态，而一般将来时只是表示将来要发生的动作。

**示例：**

- I will finish the work tomorrow. (一般将来时 - 明天完成工作)
- I will have finished the work by tomorrow evening. (将来完成时 - 到明天晚上之前就完成工作)

### 将来完成时 vs 现在完成时

将来完成时是以将来某个时间点为参照点，而现在完成时是以现在为参照点。

**示例：**

- I have worked here for five years. (现在完成时 - 到现在为止已工作五年)
- By next year, I will have worked here for six years. (将来完成时 - 到明年将已工作六年)

## 常见用法和例句

### 1. 与时间表达搭配

常与以下时间表达搭配使用：

- by + 将来时间点
- by the time + 从句
- before + 将来时间点

**示例：**

- By 2025, we will have built a new factory.
- By the time you wake up, I will have left.

### 2. 表示推测

用于对将来某个时间点的情况进行推测：

- The meeting will have finished by now.

### 3. 描述成就或目标

用于描述在将来某个时间点之前要达到的目标：

- By the end of this year, I will have saved enough money for a car.
- By graduation, she will have published three papers.

## 注意事项

1. 将来完成时通常需要一个明确的将来时间点作为参照：

   - ✔️ By next week, I will have completed the project.
   - ❌ I will have completed the project. (缺少时间参照点)

2. 在时间状语从句中，要用现在完成时而不是将来完成时：

   - When I have finished (不是 will have finished) my homework, I will call you.
   - After she has graduated (不是 will have graduated), she plans to travel.

3. 将来完成时常与以下时间表达一起使用：
   - by then
   - by that time
   - by the end of...
   - before...
   - when...
