past point -------- future point -------- now -------- future

↑   ------------------------    ↑

从过去看 --------在过去将来某时间点之前要完成的动作

这种时态用于描述从过去某一时间点来看，在将来某一时刻之前要完成的动作。

## 语法形式

过去将来完成时的构成是：**主语 + would have + 过去分词**

- **肯定句**：主语 + would have + 过去分词

  - I would have finished.
  - She would have graduated.

- **否定句**：主语 + would not have + 过去分词

  - I would not (wouldn't) have finished.
  - She would not (wouldn't) have graduated.

- **疑问句**：Would + 主语 + have + 过去分词？
  - Would you have finished?
  - Would she have graduated?

## 应用场景

### 1. 表示过去预期的将来完成的动作

用于描述在过去某一时刻，预期在将来某个时间点之前要完成的动作。

**示例：**

- He said he would have finished the work by Friday. (他说他会在星期五之前完成工作。)
- I knew she would have left before I arrived. (我知道在我到达之前她就会离开。)

### 2. 间接引语中的将来完成时

在间接引语中，将来完成时变成过去将来完成时。

**示例：**

- Direct: "I will have completed the project by next week." (我下周之前会完成这个项目。)
- Indirect: She said she would have completed the project by the following week. (她说她会在下周之前完成这个项目。)

### 3. 表示未实现的过去假设

用于表示过去某个未能实现的假设情况。

**示例：**

- She would have graduated by now if she hadn't quit school. (如果她没有退学的话，她现在已经毕业了。)

## 与其他时态的对比

### 过去将来完成时 vs 将来完成时

过去将来完成时是从过去的视角看将来的完成动作，而将来完成时是从现在的视角看将来的完成动作。

**示例：**

- I will have finished the work by tomorrow. (将来完成时 - 从现在看)
- He said he would have finished the work by the next day. (过去将来完成时 - 从过去看)

### 过去将来完成时 vs 过去完成时

过去将来完成时表示在过去某一时刻之后要完成的动作，而过去完成时表示在过去某一时刻之前已经完成的动作。

**示例：**

- I had finished the work before he arrived. (过去完成时 - 过去的完成)
- I knew I would have finished the work before he arrived. (过去将来完成时 - 过去对将来的预期)

## 常见用法和例句

### 2. 表示预期的完成

用于表达过去对将来完成的预期：

## 注意事项

1. 过去将来完成时通常需要一个明确的时间参照点：

   - ✔️ He said he would have finished by Monday.
   - ❌ He said he would have finished. (缺少时间参照点)

2. 在时间状语从句中，要用现在完成时而不是过去将来完成时：

   - When I have finished (不是 would have finished), I will call you.
   - After she has graduated (不是 would have graduated), she plans to travel.

3. 过去将来完成时常与以下时间表达一起使用：
   - by then
   - by that time
   - by the end of...
   - before...
   - when...
