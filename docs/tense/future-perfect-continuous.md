## 注意事项

1. 不是所有动词都适合用于进行时态：

   - ❌ I will have been knowing him for five years.
   - ✔️ I will have known him for five years.

2. 将来完成进行时通常需要一个明确的时间参照点：

   - ✔️ By next week, I will have been working on this project for a month.
   - ❌ I will have been working on this project. (缺少时间参照)

3. 在时间状语从句中，要用现在完成进行时而不是将来完成进行时：
   - When I have been working (不是 will have been working) here for ten years, I will get a promotion.
   - After she has been studying (不是 will have been studying) for three hours, she will take a break.
