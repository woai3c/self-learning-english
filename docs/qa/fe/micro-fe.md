## What challenges and opportunities does micro-frontend architecture bring to front-end development, and how do you overcome these challenges?

You know, I think the main benefit of micro-frontends is that they let you connect different applications together. Like, if you need to integrate some legacy apps into your current system, you can use micro-frontends instead of having to rewrite everything from scratch.

But yeah, there are definitely some challenges to deal with. You've got things like communication between modules, data sharing, and style isolation to figure out. Plus, it can be pretty complicated to set up and use. Actually, if you're building a brand new application, I wouldn't really recommend using micro-frontends - it's better to avoid potential headaches.

These days, I mainly use some well-established micro-frontend frameworks to handle these issues, like qiankun and micro-app. They work pretty well and take care of a lot of the common problems.

微前端架构给前端开发带来了哪些挑战和机遇？您是如何克服这些挑战的？

我觉得微前端最主要的好处就是可以把不同的应用连接在一起。假如现在需要把一些老应用集成到当前应用里，那么就可以使用微前端了，而不是把老应用都重写一遍。但是微前端存在不少要解决的问题，例如模块之间的通信、数据共享、样式隔离等，并且使用起来比较麻烦。如果是全新应用，就没有必要上微前端了，避免踩坑。我目前主要使用一些比较成熟的微前端框架来解决这些问题，例如 qiankun、micro-app，使用效果还不错。
