## What is front-end engineering? What benefits does it bring?

Well, front-end engineering is basically about applying software engineering principles to front-end development. You know, the main goal is to improve our code quality, boost team efficiency, and reduce development costs. More specifically, it covers things like setting up team standards, build and packaging processes, performance optimization, and CI/CD - all these are part of front-end engineering because they help us work better and deliver better quality code.

什么是前端工程化？它带来了哪些好处？

前端工程化其实就是把软件工程的思想和方法论应用到前端上，换句话说，前端工程化的目的就是提高前端软件的质量、团队的开发效率以及降低开发成本。具体一点说的话，制定团队规范、构建打包、性能优化、ci/cd 都可以算是前端工程化的范围，因为它们本质上都是为了提高开发效率和软件质量。

## Could you share one of your proudest implementations or improvements in engineering?

Yeah, I'm particularly proud of our CI/CD improvements. Let me tell you about it - first, we set up automatic code checks and fixes that trigger whenever code is submitted. Then, after code merges, we use GitLab CI to package everything into a Docker image and deploy it to Kubernetes. This really cuts down on manual work and speeds up our development process.

Also, I helped establish and promote our team's technical standards. This has been great for improving both our code quality and how efficiently we work together.

能否分享一下您在工程化方面最自豪的改进或实现？

可以的，我觉得主要是 ci/cd 方面的改进，这包含了几个方面：首先是提交代码时自动触发代码校验和自动修复；然后是合并代码后通过 gitlab ci 打包成 docker 镜像并部署到 k8s，这样可以减少人工操作，提高开发效率。

另外还有团队技术规范的制定和推广，这可以帮助提高团队的代码质量和协作效率。
