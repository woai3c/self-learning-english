## What is front-end engineering? What benefits does it bring?

Front-end engineering is the application of software engineering principles and methodologies to front-end development. In other words, the goal of front-end engineering is to improve the quality of front-end software, increase team development efficiency, and reduce development costs. More specifically, setting team specifications, build packaging, performance optimization, and CI/CD can all be considered part of front-end engineering, as they fundamentally aim to enhance development efficiency and software quality.

什么是前端工程化？它带来了哪些好处？

前端工程化其实就是把软件工程的思想和方法论应用到前端上，换句话说，前端工程化的目的就是提高前端软件的质量、团队的开发效率以及降低开发成本。具体一点说的话，制定团队规范、构建打包、性能优化、ci/cd 都可以算是前端工程化的范围，因为它们本质上都是为了提高开发效率和软件质量。

## Could you share one of your proudest implementations or improvements in engineering?

Sure, I'm particularly proud of improvements in CI/CD. This includes a few aspects: First, automatic code checks and fixes are triggered when code is submitted. Then, after code merges, GitLab CI packages it into a Docker image and deploys it to Kubernetes. This reduces manual work and boosts development efficiency.

Another aspect is the establishment and promotion of team technical specifications. This helps improve the quality of our code and the efficiency of our collaboration.

能否分享一下您在工程化方面最自豪的改进或实现？

可以的，我觉得主要是 ci/cd 方面的改进，这包含了几个方面：首先是提交代码时自动触发代码校验和自动修复；然后是合并代码后通过 gitlab ci 打包成 docker 镜像并部署到 k8s，这样可以减少人工操作，提高开发效率。

另外还有团队技术规范的制定和推广，这可以帮助提高团队的代码质量和协作效率。
