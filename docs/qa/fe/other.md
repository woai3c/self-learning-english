## What is front-end engineering? What benefits does it bring?

Front-end engineering is the application of software engineering principles and methodologies to front-end development. In other words, the goal of front-end engineering is to improve the quality of front-end software, increase team development efficiency, and reduce development costs. More specifically, setting team standards, build packaging, performance optimization, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) can all be considered part of front-end engineering, as they fundamentally aim to enhance development efficiency and software quality.

什么是前端工程化？它带来了哪些好处？

前端工程化其实就是把软件工程的思想和方法论应用到前端上，换句话说，前端工程化的目的就是提高前端软件的质量、团队的开发效率以及降低开发成本。具体一点说的话，制定团队规范、构建打包、性能优化、ci/cd 都可以算是前端工程化的范围，因为它们本质上都是为了提高开发效率和软件质量。
