## Please introduce yourself briefly

Hey, I'm Tan. I switched careers to programming back in 2017, so I've been doing this for about 8 years now. I'm a full-stack developer, and I'm strong on the front-end side, I also use Node.js for backend work. You know, in the past year, I've also been getting into Solidity and Web3 stuff - I'm actually planning to dive deeper into that and become a senior Web3 engineer. I'm super passionate about programming - I love working on open source projects and contributing to the community through Github. Right now, I'm looking for new opportunities. Feel free to ask me anything!

请简单介绍一下自己

我叫 Tan，是 17 年转行当的程序员，到现在已经有 8 年了。我是一名全栈工程师，比较擅长前端，后端使用的是 Nodejs，最近一年里我还学习了 Solidity 和 Web3 的相关知识，而且打算继续深入学习，争取成为一名资深的 Web3 工程师。我对编程很感兴趣，平时会写一些开源项目放到 Github 上，并且也会为一些开源项目贡献代码。我目前正在找工作。如果您有什么问题，可以随时问我。

</details>

## Why did you switch careers to become a programmer?

Before programming, I tried all kinds of jobs - sales, manual labor, IT support - but nothing really clicked. I felt lost until I discovered programming through Zhihu. It just felt right - interesting and challenging. So I quit my job, spent three months learning to code at home, and finally landed my first front-end job.

<details>
<summary>查看中文</summary>
为什么要转行成为程序员？

因为对之前的工作不满意，我之前做过销售、工人、搬运工等工作，但是一直觉得没意思，很迷惘，不知道自己应该做什么。后来无意中在知乎了解到编程和程序员这个职业，觉得这个职业很适合我，很有趣，也非常有挑战性。所以我决定辞职在家自学编程，并且经过三个月的努力，我也成功转行，成为了一名前端。

</details>

## Talk about your career planning.

My goal is to become a world-class programmer. In the next 3-5 years, I want to become an expert Web3 engineer and learn Rust to better understand low-level programming. I also want to create or contribute to some well-known open-source projects.

Besides the technical stuff, I'm looking to join a company where I can grow and make real impact - you know, using my skills to solve real business problems and build valuable products.

<details>

谈一下你的职业规划

我的目标是成为一名世界级的程序员。目前制定了一个 3-5 年的计划。这个计划有几个小目标，例如成为一名资深的 Web3 工程师，还有熟练掌握 Rust 语言，这样能让我更加了解计算机的底层知识。然后自己开发或者参与一些知名的开源项目，提高自己的知名度和技术视野。

上面是比较偏向技术方面的规划，在工作上我想加入一家合适的公司，和公司共同发展，在熟悉公司业务的同时，用我的技术为业务赋能，研发出一些有价值的产品。

</details>

## What kind of working environment do you like?

I enjoy working in an environment that's straightforward and positive, where people collaborate well together and everyone is working towards the same goals. Good communication and mutual support are really important to me.

<details>

你喜欢什么样的工作环境？

我喜欢简单直接，积极向上的工作环境，大家能够相互合作，一起为公司的目标而努力。

</details>

## How do you handle pressure or stressful situations?

I believe staying calm is key when dealing with pressure. Of course, we're all human and it's normal to feel stressed, but I try my best to keep a clear head. When facing difficult situations, I first take a step back, analyze the problem, and then work on finding solutions. If I'm really stuck, I don't hesitate to reach out to my team lead for guidance.

<details>
<summary>查看中文</summary>
您如何应对压力或紧张的情况？

我觉得无论发生情况，保持冷静是最重要的。当然，人不是机器，不可能没有情绪波动，但是我们要尽量控制好情绪保持冷静。在这种情况下我再去分析问题，然后找到解决问题的方法。如果遇到问题解决不了，我会领导请教。

在这种情况下千万不能焦虑或者被情绪左右，否则会影响工作效率和破坏团队氛围。

</details>

## Do you prefer individual action or teamwork?

You know, I'm comfortable with both. Whether it's working solo or as part of a team, what matters is getting the job done well. I'm pretty good at working independently when needed, but I also enjoy collaborating with others. Actually, I find that teamwork often leads to better results because everyone brings different perspectives and skills to the table.

<details>

你喜欢个人行动还是团队合作？

这两种我都喜欢，我觉得个人行动还是团队合作都是为了把事做好。如果需要我单独行动，我会接受，然后去做，因为我单兵作战能力很强。如果需要团队合作，我也会积极配合，因为团队合作能够把事情做的更好。

</details>

## How do you handle multiple tasks at the same time?

Well, the first thing I do is check in with my team lead about priorities. I like to understand what's most urgent and important, figure out the minimum requirements for each task, and then plan my work accordingly. It's all about good organization and clear communication.

<details>
<summary>查看中文</summary>
当你同时有多个任务时，如何处理

我会和领导确认任务的优先级和重要性，确认每个任务的最小完成工作量、可交付目标是什么，然后根据任务的优先级和重要性来安排工作。

</details>

## Talk about a moment or specific contribution in a project that you take particular pride in. What impact did it have, and how did you overcome the challenges involved?

Actually, one of my proudest moments was when I successfully switched careers to become a developer. It was a real turning point in my life. Before that, I was kind of drifting without a clear direction, not making much money. Learning to code gave me something I'm really passionate about and a clear goal - becoming a world-class programmer. When I ran into problems while teaching myself programming, I'd dig through documentation, search online, and reach out to tech communities for help. It wasn't easy, but it was definitely worth it.

<details>

谈谈一个你引以为豪的时刻或者项目里的特定贡献。它带来了什么影响？您是如何克服挑战的？

我觉得是我通过自学编程，成为程序员的那一刻。转行成为程序员是我人生的转折点，如果没有成为程序员，我现在可能还是无所事事，一个月挣两三千。学会编程让我有了热爱的事情，让人生有了追求，我的目标就是成为一名世界级的程序员。在自学编程遇到问题的时候，我一般会通过查资料、在技术社区提问的方式来解决。

</details>

## Your English is not very good.

Yeah, I know my English isn't perfect, but I'm working hard to improve it. I actually spend about 3 hours every day studying vocabulary and practicing speaking. It's getting better day by day, and I'm confident that communication won't be an issue in the future.

<details>

你的英语不是很好

是的，我的英语不是很好。但是，这并不意味着我的英语会一直这样。最近，我每天都会花费超过3个小时来记忆词汇和练习口语。因此，我的英语会继续提高，沟通将不再是问题。

</details>

## What are your weaknesses?

Well, to be honest, my English isn't as strong as I'd like it to be. But I'm committed to improving it - I spend time every day learning new words and practicing my speaking skills. I believe with consistent effort, it'll keep getting better.

<details>
<summary>查看中文</summary>
你的缺点是什么？

英语不够好，但是我一直有在提升英语，包括每天背单词和练习口语。我相信通过不断的努力，我的英语会越来越好。

</details>

## What are your strengths?

I'd say my biggest strength is my solid technical background. I've developed full-stack capabilities and I'm particularly strong in front-end development. I'm passionate about programming and I'm good at picking up new things on my own. You know, I'm always learning and improving, which I think is super important in tech.

<details>

你的优势是什么？

我的优势是我扎实的技术水平，我目前拥有全栈的开发能力，同时也是一名资深的前端工程师。我对编程拥有极大的热情，自学能力也很强。所以未来我的能力是会持续提升的，这也是我最大的优势。

</details>

## What did you do last year to improve your knowledge?

Last year, I mainly focused on learning Web3 technologies - you know, stuff like Solidity, Ethers.js, and Hardhat. The cool thing is I actually got to use these technologies in my work projects.
