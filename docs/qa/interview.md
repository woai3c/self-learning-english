## Please introduce yourself briefly

My name is Tan, and I switched careers to become a programmer in 2017, which means I have been in the field for 7 years now. I am a full-stack developer with a stronger focus on front-end, and I use Node.js for backend. I am very interested in programming. I usually write some open source projects and put them on Github, and I also contribute code to other open source projects. I am currently unemployed and looking for work. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me anytime.

请简单介绍一下自己

我叫 Tan，是 17 年转行当的程序员，到现在已经有 7 年了。我属于偏前端的全栈，后端使用的是 Nodejs。我对编程很感兴趣，平时会写一些开源项目放到 Github 上，并且也会为一些开源项目贡献代码。我目前是离职状态，正在找工作。如果您有什么问题，可以随时问我。

</details>

## Why did you switch careers to become a programmer?

Due to dissatisfaction with my previous jobs, I've done a variety of work, like sales, laborer, a computer repair technician and so on. But I always felt it was boring and I was lost, not knowing what I should do. Then, I stumbled upon programming and the job of a programmer on Zhihu. I thought this job was a good fit for me, interesting, and very challenging. So, I decided to quit my job and learn programming at home. After three months of hard work, I successfully changed careers and became a front-end developer.

为什么要转行成为程序员？

因为对之前的工作不满意，我之前做过销售、工人、搬运工等工作，但是一直觉得没意思，很迷惘，不知道自己应该做什么。后来无意中在知乎了解到编程和程序员这个职业，觉得这个职业很适合我，很有趣，也非常有挑战性。所以我决定辞职在家自学编程，并且经过三个月的努力，我也成功转行，成为了一名前端。

</details>

## Talk about your career planning.

My goal is to become a world-class programmer. I have currently set a 3-5 year plan. This plan has several small goals, such as becoming an expert in the front-end field and a full-stack engineer, as well as learning a system-level programming language, such as Rust, which can enhance my understanding of computer fundamentals. Then, I want to develop or participate in some well-known open-source projects to enhance my reputation and technical perspective.

The above is a more technical-oriented plan. In terms of work, I want to join a suitable company and grow with the company. While familiarizing myself with the company's business, I want to use my technology to empower the business and develop some valuable products.

<details>

谈一下你的职业规划

我的目标是成为一名世界级的程序员。目前制定了一个 3-5 年的计划。这个计划有几个小目标，例如要成为前端领域专家和全栈工程师，以及学会一门系统级的编程语言，例如 Rust，这样能让我更加了解计算机的底层知识。然后自己开发或者参与一些知名的开源项目，提高自己的知名度和技术视野。

上面是比较偏向技术方面的规划，在工作上我想加入一家合适的公司，和公司共同发展，在熟悉公司业务的同时，用我的技术为业务赋能，研发出一些有价值的产品。

</details>

## What kind of working environment do you like?

I enjoy a simple and straightforward, positive working environment where everyone cooperates and works together towards the company's goals.

<details>

你喜欢什么样的工作环境？

我喜欢简单直接，积极向上的工作环境，大家能够相互合作，一起为公司的目标而努力。

</details>

## How do you handle pressure or stressful situations?

No matter the situation, I believe staying calm is most important. Of course, people aren't machines; it is impossible not to fluctuate emotionally, but we should control our emotions as much as possible to maintain calm. In such situations, I would analyze the problem and then find a solution. If I can't resolve the issue, I will seek advice from leader.

<details>

您如何应对压力或紧张的情况？

我觉得无论发生情况，保持冷静是最重要的。当然，人不是机器，不可能没有情绪波动，但是我们要尽量控制好情绪保持冷静。在这种情况下我再去分析问题，然后找到解决问题的方法。如果遇到问题解决不了，我会领导请教。

在这种情况下千万不能焦虑或者被情绪左右，否则会影响工作效率和破坏团队氛围。

</details>

## Do you prefer individual action or teamwork?

I like both; I believe that whether individual action or teamwork, the goal is to do things well. If I need to act alone, I will accept the challenge and proceed because I have strong independent working ability. If teamwork is needed, I will cooperate actively, as teamwork can often achieve better results.

<details>

你喜欢个人行动还是团队合作？

这两种我都喜欢，我觉得个人行动还是团队合作都是为了把事做好。如果需要我单独行动，我会接受，然后去做，因为我单兵作战能力很强。如果需要团队合作，我也会积极配合，因为团队合作能够把事情做的更好。

</details>

## How do you handle multiple tasks at the same time?

I would confirm the priority and importance of each task with my leader, determine the minimum viable work and deliverable targets for each task, and then arrange my work based on the priority and importance of the tasks.

<details>
<summary>查看中文</summary>
当你同时有多个任务时，如何处理

我会和领导确认任务的优先级和重要性，确认每个任务的最小完成工作量、可交付目标是什么，然后根据任务的优先级和重要性来安排工作。

</details>

## Talk about a moment or specific contribution in a project that you take particular pride in. What impact did it have, and how did you overcome the challenges involved?

A moment I take pride in is when I taught myself programming and became a developer. Becoming a developer was a turning point in my life. Without it, I might still be aimless, earning a small income. Learning to code gave me a passion and a goal to become a world-class programmer. When I faced problems in self-learning programming, I usually solved them by researching and asking questions in tech communities.

<details>

谈谈一个你引以为豪的时刻或者项目里的特定贡献。它带来了什么影响？您是如何克服挑战的？

我觉得是我通过自学编程，成为程序员的那一刻。转行成为程序员是我人生的转折点，如果没有成为程序员，我现在可能还是无所事事，一个月挣两三千。学会编程让我有了热爱的事情，让人生有了追求，我的目标就是成为一名世界级的程序员。在自学编程遇到问题的时候，我一般会通过查资料、在技术社区提问的方式来解决。

</details>

## Your English is not very good.

Yes, my English is not very good. However, this doesn't mean my English will always be this way. Recently, I have been spending more than 3 hours every day memorizing vocabulary and practicing speaking. Therefore, my English will continue to improve, and communication will no longer be a problem.

</details>

## What did you do last year to improve your knowledge?

Last year, I primarily studied Nodejs, Docker, and K8s and applied these technologies in my work. I also created a GPT account to help me solve some development issues and write some documentation.
