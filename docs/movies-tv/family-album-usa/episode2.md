# The Blind Date

## Act 1

**Harry**: Excuse me. Can you help me?

**Vendor**: Sure, what do you want?

**Harry**: Where is 83 Wooster Street?

**Vendor**: That’s easy. Walk to the corner. Then make a left turn. Then walk two blocks to the traffic light. Make another left to Wooster.

**Harry**: Thank you. To the corner and then a left?

**Vendor**: Yeah. A left. Hot dog? Only seventy-five cents.

**Harry**: No. Thank you. I have a dinner date.

**Harry**: 555-9470... and it’s busy... Try again. 555-9470... and it’s still busy. Excuse me, ma’am. I’m looking for 83 Wooster Street.

**Woman**: Yes. Wooster Street is two blocks, and 83 is to the right about two houses.

**Harry**: Thank you, thank you!

**Woman**: You’re welcome.

**Susan**: Who is it?

**Harry**: Harry Bennett. Is this Susan?

**Susan**: Yes, it is. Come up. I’m on the top floor.

**Harry**: Nice to meet you, Susan. Sorry I’m late. The traffic. The parking. I was lost.

**Susan**: What pretty flowers! Thank you. Oh, please come in. Don’t worry about being late. It’s fine. Excuse the mess. I just moved here. Oh, I’d like you to meet my sister-in-law Marilyn. Marilyn Stewart, this is Harry Bennett.

**Harry**: Pleased to meet you.

**Marilyn**: Nice to meet you, Harry.

**Harry**: Are we too late for our dinner reservation?

**Susan**: No, the restaurant will hold our table. I know the owner very well. I eat there a lot.

**Harry**: Do you know the phone number of the restaurant? I’d like to call home and leave the number with the baby-sitter.

**Susan**: Sure. The number is... five five five... seventeen twenty.

**Harry**: May I use the phone? Five five five... one seven two oh. Hello? Hi, Michelle. It’s Daddy. Can I speak to Betty? I want to leave the phone number of the restaurant... Hi, Betty. I’ll be at five five five... seventeen twenty. OK. Thanks. See you later. Well, that’s done. Shall we go?

**Susan**: I’m ready. See you later, Marilyn.

**Marilyn**: Have a nice evening.

**Harry**: Bye, Marilyn. Hope to see you again.

**Marilyn**: Me, too. Have fun!

**Susan**: Thanks.

**Harry**: After you.

## Act 2

**Somsak**: Ah! Miss Stewart! Welcome! How are you?

**Susan**: Fine, Somsak. And you?

**Somsak**: Fine, thank you.

**Somsak**: This is my friend Harry Bennett.

**Harry**: Pleased to meet you.

**Somsak**: Very nice to meet you. Any friend of Miss Stewart’s is welcome at Somsak’s. Follow me, please.

**Harry**: I like it here.

**Susan**: I do, too. I come here often.

**Somsak**: A special place for special people.

**Susan**: Thank you, Somsak.

**Harry**: Well! Nice restaurant.

**Somsak**: Would you like something to drink?

**Susan**: Yes, I’d like a glass of ginger ale with ice. Harry, what would you like?

**Harry**: Do you have a dry white wine?

**Somsak**: How about a California chablis?

**Harry**: Chablis is fine.

**Somsak**: What would you like to eat?

**Susan**: I’d like the mee krob. Harry, would you like to see a menu?

**Harry**: No, it’s OK. I’ll have the mee krob also. What is it?

**Susan**: Crispy fried noodles. I love them.

**Somsak**: May I bring you a salad?

**Susan**: Oh yes. What do you recommend today?

**Somsak**: I recommend rose-petal salad. Special for new friends.

**Susan**: Rose-petal salad?

**Harry**: Why not?

**Somsak**: I’ll take care of everything.

**Susan**: I hope you’re hungry.

**Harry**: What? Oh, yes. Starving. Well, I...

**Susan**: Well, I...

**Harry**: What do you do at Universe Toy Company?

**Susan**: I’m the vice-president of new toy development.

**Harry**: Terrific!

**Susan**: I know you’re a CPA.

**Harry**: That’s true. Harry Bennett, certified public accountant. I love numbers. I do some work for Smith and Dale, your company’s accounting firm.

**Susan**: And so...

**Harry**: Here we are.

**Susan**: Yes.

**Harry**: I have a daughter.

**Susan**: I know. How old is she?

**Harry**: She’s nine years old.

**Susan**: That’s a nice age. What’s her name?

**Harry**: Michelle.

**Susan**: Do you have a picture of her?

**Susan**: She’s very pretty.

**Harry**: Thank you.

**Somsak**: Rose-petal salad. And there’s a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett.

**Harry**: I’ll get the rest of the dinner. Excuse me.

**Harry**: Please forgive me, Susan, but... I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...

**Susan**: What’s the matter?

**Harry**: My daughter isn’t feeling well.

**Susan**: Oh no! Is it serious?

**Harry**: I don’t know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache, and she’s crying. I’ll have to go home. Will you forgive me?

**Susan**: Of course. I’m so sorry for Michelle. And you didn’t have a chance to eat.

**Harry**: Oh, it’s OK. Let me take you home first.

**Susan**: No, no. Please, go ahead.

**Harry**: It’s our first date.

**Susan**: We’ll make another. Please don’t worry.

**Harry**: I’ll phone you.

**Susan**: I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.

**Harry**: Good-bye.

## Act 3

**Marilyn**: What happened?

**Susan**: The baby-sitter called. His daughter is sick.

**Marilyn**: What’s wrong?

**Susan**: I think she has a stomachache. He’s a good father.

**Marilyn**: So... what do you think of him?

**Susan**: He’s very nice. But I think he was nervous tonight. It was his first date in two years.

**Marilyn**: Will you see him again?

**Susan**: I hope so.

**Marilyn**: This food is delicious.

**Susan**: He didn’t get a thing to eat.

**Marilyn**: You ordered enough for three or four people, but I’m not complaining. The food is delicious.

**Susan**: Who is that?

**Marilyn**: Do you think it’s...

**Susan**: No. You won’t believe it, Marilyn!

**Marilyn**: I believe it. Even without looking.

**Harry**: Hi!

**Susan**: How...?

**Harry**: Your downstairs neighbor let me in.

**Susan**: Did you go home?

**Harry**: I did, but everything is OK, so I decided to come back. To apologize for leaving so early, I brought you a little gift. It’s a bonsai tree for your new apartment. Hi, Marilyn. I hope it’s not too late.

**Marilyn**: Oh, not at all. We’re still eating.

**Susan**: Please, come in. Join us. It’s our meal from the restaurant. And how is your daughter?

**Harry**: Oh, she’s fine. It was only a tummy ache.

**Susan**: It’s good that you went back.

**Harry**: Yes, I think it’s important for me to be there since her mother died.

**Susan**: I agree. Aren’t you hungry?

**Harry**: As a matter of fact... I am hungry.

**Marilyn**: There’s lots of food left.

**Harry**: Mmm, this is delicious!

**Susan**: Enjoy!

**Marilyn**: I’m going to excuse myself. I have a lot of work to do to get ready for tomorrow. Good night, Harry. It was nice meeting you.

**Harry**: Bye, Marilyn.

**Marilyn**: Good night, Susan.

**Susan**: Good night, Marilyn.

**Susan**: She’s going to a fashion show here in the city tomorrow. She is sleeping here so she won’t have to travel from Riverdale in the morning.

**Harry**: You two must be close.

**Susan**: We are. The whole Stewart family is close.

**Harry**: I like that.

**Harry**: And then, two years ago, my wife died.

**Susan**: You miss her.

**Harry**: I do... yes, but I have Michelle... and with time...

**Susan**: Is there anyone else in your life?

**Harry**: No, not yet. What about you?

**Susan**: Oh, I date occasionally, but my work keeps me busy.

**Harry**: Ooh, speaking of keeping busy—I have an early start tomorrow, and the baby-sitter has to get home. Where did the time go? It’s midnight. Thank you, Susan. I had a nice evening.

**Susan**: Me, too, Harry. Harry?

**Harry**: Yes?

**Susan**: I’d like to meet your daughter someday.

**Harry**: Does that mean that I can see you again?

**Susan**: Of course.

**Harry**: Wonderful. I’ll call you, and we’ll go out to dinner.

**Susan**: Please do.

**Harry**: I promise I won’t leave early.

**Susan**: It was for a good reason.

**Harry**: You know something?

**Susan**: What?

**Harry**: I think we’re going to be good friends. Good night, Susan.

**Susan**: Good night, Harry. Have a safe trip home. Are you all right?

**Harry**: Sorry.

**Susan**: I never liked that umbrella stand. Good night, Harry.
