# Full of Surprises

## Act 1

**Robbie**: The mailman just dropped some mail in our box, Grandpa.

**Grandpa**: Probably a lot of advertising and bills. Why don't you write to me, Robbie, so I can get some interesting mail?

**Robbie**: You were right, Grandpa. Advertising, bills, bills, advertising.

**Grandpa**: Yes. It's just like I said, Robbie. Nothing interesting.

**Robbie**: You won't believe it, Grandpa, but there's a letter here addressed to you, Mr. Malcolm Stewart, and it looks like a personal letter.

**Grandpa**: Oh, it must be a bill.

**Robbie**: I don't think so. The return name and address is Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.

**Grandpa**: You're joking. Pete Waters?

**Robbie**: Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton. You know him?

**Grandpa**: Do I know Pete Waters? You bet I do! He was my roommate in college. He visited with Grandma and me in Florida about five years ago.

**Robbie**: What does he say? Is he OK?

**Grandpa**: Yeah, he's fine. Just fine. He's writing to invite me to spend a weekend with him at his farm. He's planning a get-together with two or three other college friends. The kind of a fifty-year anniversary reunion.

**Robbie**: Sounds like fun. Fifty years? Wow!

**Grandpa**: It sounds like fun to me, too, Robbie.

**Robbie**: What kind of farm does he have?

**Grandpa**: I've never been there, Robbie, but he has chickens and cows and all. That means fresh eggs and fresh milk.

**Robbie**: Does he have a family?

**Grandpa**: No, he doesn't, Robbie. He never married. He's not as lucky as I am to have a family and grandchildren. I'm a lucky man.

**Robbie**: How come he never got married?

**Grandpa**: That's a good question, Robbie. A very good question. He never married because the girl he was in love with in college married someone else. As simple as that. He never got over it.

**Robbie**: He must have loved her very much.

**Grandpa**: Yes. Very much. Lillian Winters. She was in our class.

**Robbie**: And what happened?

**Grandpa**: She was in love with Donald McGrath, the quarterback on our football team.

**Robbie**: Football players are always popular with the ladies.

**Grandpa**: She liked Pete, and they went to dances together. But her heart was with Donald.

**Robbie**: Did he ever get over it?

**Grandpa**: No, he never did.

**Robbie**: Where is she today?

**Grandpa**: I don't know. Maybe Lillian will be at the reunion.

**Robbie**: You think so?

**Grandpa**: Pete's full of surprises.

**Robbie**: I wish I could go there with you, Grandpa. What do you think the surprise will be?

**Grandpa**: With Pete, you never know, Robbie.

**Robbie**: Won't it be exciting to see all your college friends there again?

**Grandpa**: It is already. I'm kind of excited about going now. Next weekend... sleep over Friday and Saturday night and come back Sunday. I can't wait!

**Robbie**: Don't you think you ought to call Pete and tell him you're coming?

**Grandpa**: You're reading my mind, Robbie.

## Act 2

**Attendant**: Hello. What can I do for you?

**Grandpa**: Hi. Fill'er up. I need a full tank.

**Attendant**: Check the hood?

**Grandpa**: No, thanks.

**Attendant**: Whereabouts are you headed?

**Grandpa**: Pete Waters's farm, near Chesterton.

**Attendant**: I know it well. Pete Waters has lived around here almost as long as I have.

**Grandpa**: How long is it going to take for me to get there?

**Attendant**: About fifteen minutes. There's a shortcut—if you know it.

**Grandpa**: No, I don't. Could you tell me how to use the shortcut?

**Attendant**: Sure. You take the next left turn. You'll see a stop sign. Make a right at the stop sign. Stay on that road, and you'll cross a blue bridge. Then you'll see a big old red barn. That's the back of Pete Waters's place.

**Grandpa**: That's quite a difference from the directions that Pete sent me.

**Attendant**: Now, if you take that route, it's probably a lot simpler, but it'll take you ten minutes longer.

**Grandpa**: OK. Let me repeat it. I take the next left turn to the stop sign. Then a right across a blue bridge, and then a big red barn.

**Attendant**: Can't miss it.

**Grandpa**: How much do I owe you?

**Attendant**: Well, that'll be eighteen dollars and seventy cents. No charge for the cleanup. It's on the house.

**Grandpa**: Well, here's a twenty.

**Attendant**: Ah. OK. That's a dollar and thirty cents change. There we go... will make twenty. Thanks.

**Grandpa**: Thank you. And thanks for the directions.

**Grandpa**: This must be Pete's barn. Turn right to the house. Hi.

**Worker**: Hi. What can I do for you?

**Grandpa**: Is this the Pete Waters farm?

**Worker**: It is.

**Grandpa**: I'm a friend of Pete's. I'm looking for the house.

**Worker**: It's just over yonder. Keep along this road till you get to the end of the fence. You'll see the chickens. His house is on the left.

**Grandpa**: Well, thanks.

**Grandpa**: "Have gone to the railroad station. Back soon with a surprise. Make yourself at home. Have a look around. Pete." Same old Pete Waters. Always full of surprises.

## Act 3

**Arnold**: Don't tell me. Please don't tell me. I recognize you...

**Peggy**: Oh, don't be silly, Arnie. Of course you recognize him. Except for the beard, he hasn't changed in fifty years. It's Malcolm Stewart!

**Arnold**: I know it's Malcolm Stewart. You haven't changed much in fifty years.

**Grandpa**: Peggy—Peggy Pendleton! You're Peggy Pendleton!

**Arnold**: Who am I, you old rascal? You don't recognize me, do you?

**Grandpa**: I know who you are. You're Arnold Franklin! I know who you are!

**Peggy**: You look wonderful, Malcolm!

**Grandpa**: Sit down. Pete isn't home.

**Arnold**: Really?

**Grandpa**: No. He left a note on the door saying he was going to the railroad station to pick up a surprise.

**Peggy**: He's so funny. Always full of surprises, even fifty years later.

**Grandpa**: The two of you look unbelievable!

**Arnold**: How's your family? Oh, I was sorry to hear about your wife having passed away.

**Grandpa**: Yes. About four years ago.

**Peggy**: And you're living with your children now? In New York? Pete wrote us and told us.

**Grandpa**: Yup. Retired and moved to New York to live with my son and his family.

**Peggy**: By the way, what do you think this big surprise is?

**Arnold**: It could be most anything, knowing Pete.

**Grandpa**: Hey, that must be Pete! Now we'll find out about the surprise.

**Pete**: So good to see you all!

**Peggy**: Oh, Pete, Pete! Oh, it's so good to see you!

**Pete**: Remember Lillian?

**Lillian**: I remember all of you. You haven't changed a bit.

**Peggy**: Lillian! Oh, my gosh!

**Arnold**: Lillian Winters. We were together in the Thursday night drama society.

**Lillian**: Remember me, Malcolm?

**Grandpa**: Oh, beautiful as ever, Lillian. How's Donald?

**Lillian**: That's OK, Malcolm. Donald passed away a couple of years ago.

**Arnold**: Sorry to hear that, Lillian.

**Peggy**: Oh, I'm so sorry.

**Arnold**: I would not have missed this get-together for the world!

**Grandpa**: And your little surprise, Pete? You really surprised me by having us all come together.

**Pete**: You don't know what the surprise is yet? Come on! We'll tell you the big surprise.

**Pete**: I've invited you here for the weekend to help celebrate.

**Peggy**: Celebrate?

**Grandpa**: Our fiftieth reunion?

**Arnold**: No.

**Lillian**: No. Pete wants to tell you...

**Pete**: Now, let me have the honor, Lillian.

**Grandpa**: For goodness sake, Pete, tell us! I can't wait much longer.

**Pete**: Well, I am pouring this iced tea so that we can toast Lillian—and me.

**Peggy**: You don't mean to tell me that you and...

**Pete**: Yes, I do. I have loved Lillian all these years, so I asked her to be Mrs. Pete Waters.

**Lillian**: And I said yes.

**Grandpa**: I knew it! Congratulations!

**Peggy**: Oh, Lillian, I am so happy for you both.

**Arnold**: It's wonderful!

**Pete**: It's wonderful for me. Lillian will make me a happy man finally.

**Grandpa**: You are full of surprises, Pete.

**Pete**: We are going to spend the entire weekend having a good time together here on the farm. We are going to celebrate all weekend.

**Peggy**: When is the wedding?

**Pete**: That's another surprise. Lillian and I were married two weeks ago in Detroit. She's come here to stay.

**Grandpa**: Wait till I tell my family about this!

**Peggy**: Why, that's wonderful!
