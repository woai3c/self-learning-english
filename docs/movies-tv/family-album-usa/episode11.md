# A Place of Our Own

## Act 1

**Marilyn**: Ellen, I'd like your opinion

**Ellen**: About what?

**Marilyn**: Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming we need to have our own place to live.

**Ellen**: Oh.

**Marilyn**: Well, what do you think about Richard and me looking for a small house or an apartmnt at this point in our lives?

**Ellen**: We love having you here, and there is room, and...and when the baby comes, the baby can stay in your room for a while.

**Marilyn**: Richard feels we need to find a small house.

**Ellen**: I remember when I was pregnant with Richard.Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa. Philip was a young doctor, and he kept talking about having a house of our own. It's natural.

**Marilyn**: What did you do ?

**Ellen**: We looked at a lot of houses.

**Marilyn**: Did you find one?

**Ellen**: Oh, not at first. We couldn't afford it.Grandpa wanted to led us the money to buy one, but philip is too independent. He didn't want to borrow any money.

**Marilyn**: Sounds like Richard.

**Ellen**: They're all alike. Richard is a real Stewart. He's independent, and sometimes just stubbom.

**Marilyn**: When did you buy a house?

**Ellen**: After Richard was born. I was teaching music,and Philip was opening his first meical office.

**Marilyn**: Where was the house?

**Ellen**: Right here in Riverdate. Of course, it was a small house, but just right for us.

**Marilyn**: It's funny. History repeats itself. Now Richard and I are having a baby, and we prbably won't be able to afford a house right away, either.

**Ellen**: Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn?

**Marilyn**: Good idea.

**Ellen**: Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times. You'll learn a lot.

**Marilyn**: Maybe we should speak to a real-estate agent about a house.

**Ellen**: And a bank about a mortgage.

**Marilyn**: I'll talk to Richard about it. I think it's a good idea, Ellen. We can learn a lot by asking.

**Ellen**: And if I can be of any help, let me know. As a matter of fact, my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.

**Marilyn**: Good.

**Ellen**: You won't believe this, but she sold us our first house and this one.

**Marilyn**: Well, I'll tell Richard, and we'll go to see her. Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen? Do you think it's too long?

**Ellen**: I think the skirt is just right. Are you planning to attach a train to it?

**Marilyn**: No. No train. Just the dress. But I am going to make a headpiece of lace.

**Ellen**: That dress is gorgeous.

**Marilyn**: Thanks, Ellen. And thanks for the advice about the house. I'll talk to Richard about it the minute the comes home.

**Ellen**: And remember, we love having you here. There's no need to rush.

## Act 2

**Virginia**: I remember your parents' first house very well. It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.

**Richard**: I grew up in that house.

**Virginia**: Yes, and you were such a cute baby.

**Marilyn**: I've seen pictures of him. He had blond hair.

**Virginia**: I've been friendly with the Stewart family for a long time, so It's my pleasure to help you find a house now.

**Richard**: Well, we're not sure we can afford one.

**Marilyn**: But we'd like to find ut about the possibileties.

**Virginia**: That's a good idea. I love your house on Linden Street. I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.

**Marilyn**: Really?

**Richard**: Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then, and they needed the extra room.

**Virginia**: I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs.Stewart.

**Marilyn**: Mmm-hmm. So we will be needing more room.

**Virginia**: Oh, so you don't need something immediately?

**Richard**: No. But in five or six months...

**Marilyn**: And time passes so quickly.

**Virginia**: Yes, it does. Well, when you called, you gave me enough information about your salaries and your savings. So I have a good idea about your financial situation. Let me show your some pictures of houses.

**Marilyn**: With two bedrooms?

**Virginia**: Yes, I think I can show you some. Of course, they won't be in Riverdale. The cost of housing's too high for you here.

**Richard**: I haven't thought about living anywhere else. We've always lived in this area.

**Marilyn**: Where should we look for a house, Mrs.Martinelli?

**Virginia**: Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco. It's a lovely area, and it's only about an hour's rive from here. Here. I have a book with photos of some homes in that area. Now, let's see. Here. This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.

**Marilyn**: It's pretty, but I prefer a two-story home.

**Richard**: I do, too. I don't care for a ranch type.

**Virginia**: OK. Oh, this is a wonderful house. I know it well. I sold it to the present owners.

**Richard**: It looks wonderful.

**Virginia**: This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house. It has a full basement, and it is on a half- acre lot. You can probably afford this one.

**Marilyn**: I like this house.

**Richard**: So do I.

**Virginia**: And the price is right. Would you like to go see it?

**Richard**: Yes. We're planning to talk to someone at the bank next week. Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.

**Virginia**: If some one doesn't buy it before then. But let's keep looking. Just to get an idea of some other possibillties.

**Richard**: This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.

**Virginia**: Here. This is a wounderful example of Spanish-style architecture.

**Richard**: Oh, I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.

**Marilyn**: It looks like the houses in Hollywood.

**Virginia**: It's interesting. A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price. Oh my! Here's a real buy. It's a bargain. This house just came on the market.

**Marilyn**: It's quite lovely. Is it a two-bedroom house?

**Virginia**: No. It has three bedrooms and three baths. I know the house. It has a brand new kitchen. And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. And there's a two-car garage.

**Richard**: Then why don't we go look at this house, too?

**Virginia**: It's a good investment.

**Richard**: Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.

**Marilyn**: Thanks so much.

**Virginia**: My pleasure. Give my best to your parents.

**Virginia**: Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard. He took care of my daughter when she was a child. He's the best pediatrician in Westchester.

**Richard**: Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli, I'll give them your regards.

**Marilyn**: We really appreciate your advice.

**Virginia**: I do think you should go see the houses and talk to the bank. Here. Let me give you some information sheets abo the houses. They're both very good buys.

**Richard**: Well, thanks so much for your help and your time, Mrs. Martinelli. We've got a lot to talk about.

**Marilyn**: Mmm-hmm. Thanks.

## Act 3

**Mr**:.Riley How do you do?

**Richard**: Hello.

**Mr**:.Riley I'm Ralph Riley.

**Richard**: I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.

**Mr**:.Riley Pleased to meet you.

**Marilyn**: Likewise, Mr.Riley.

**MR**:.Riley Please, sit down. What can I do for you?

**Richard**: We'd like to discuss a mortgage.

**Marilyn**: For a house.

**Mr**:.Riley Fine. Are you buying a house or are you reinancing your present home?

**Richard**: We're planning to buy a house.

**Marilyn**: And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.

**Richard**: We are customers of the bank. As a matter of fact, my whole Family banks here.

**Mr**:.Riley I have some questions to ask. Do you own your house or do you rent?

**Richard**: Neither. We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.

**Mr**:.Riley And how old are you?

**Marilyn**: I'm twenty-nine.

**Richard**: I'm thirty.

**Mr**:.Riley And, Mr. Stewat, what is your occupation?

**RIchard**: I'm a freelance photographer.

**Mr**:.Riley And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?

**Marilyn**: Yes.I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.

**Mr**:.Riley Did you bring any savings or salary information? Last year's tax forms?

**Richard**: Yes. Here they are.

**Mr**:.Riley OK.What...what kind of house did you have in mind?

**Richard**: We're talking about buying a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco.Here are the financial details on the house.

**Mr**:.Riley Thank you. Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?

**Richard**: Yes, we are.

**Mr**:.Riley Payments over thirty years?

**Richard**: Yes.

**Marilyn**: Do you think we can get a loan?

**Mr**:.Riley Well, it depends. Do you own any other property? Any stocks or bonds?

**Richard**: No.

**Mr**:.Riley I see. Then you don't have any collateral. Perhaps you could get a guarantor- someone to sign for the loan for you.

**Richard**: Why is that necessary?

**Mr**:.Riley Since you don't have enough income, and you don't already own any property, the bank needs to be sure you can pay the mortgage every month. A gauarntor is responsible for the loan if you can't make the payments.

**Richard**: I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.

**Marilyn**: Thank you, Mr.Riley. We'll read this over carefully.

**Mr**:.Riley Thank you.

**Richard**: Good-bye. Thanks.

**Mr**:.Riley Godd-bye.And hope to see you soon.

**Richard**: I hope so, too.

**Mr**:.Riley Take care.

**Marilyn**: Good-bye.

**Richard**: It all sounded so easy until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.

**Marilyn**: We have no collateral.

**Richard**: And I don't think it's a good idea to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor. I don't feel right about it.

**Marilyn**: I understand your feelings about it, Richard.

**Ellen**: Now, tell me, what's the problem?

**Marilyn**: We can get a loan from the bank if we can put up some collateral.

**Richard**: And we don't own anything to use as collateral.

**Marilyn**: Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.

**Ellen**: Why don't you speak to Dad?

**Richard**: No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.

**Ellen**: Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.

**Marilyn**: I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.

**Richard**: In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book and be able to put more money down.

**Marilyn**: What about the house in Mount Kisco? Somebody else'll buy it by then.

**Richard**: Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.

**Ellen**: Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look.

**Marilyn**: We're in no great rush. It's true.

**Richard**: This has been a great learning experienc for us, Marilyn.Talking to the real-estate agent. Looking at the houses.Talking to the loan officer at the bank.

**Marilyn**: It has been a learning experience. That's true.

**Ellen**: I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time.Looking around.Especially with a purchase of this kind.You're talking about a lot of money.

**Marilyn**: We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.

**Richard**: And I'll call Mr.Riley at the bank and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.

**Ellen**: And if you ever need Dad or me to help you...

**Marilyn**: We know.

**Ellen**: You know we'll be there for you.

**Richard**: It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family.
