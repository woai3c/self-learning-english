# Making a Difference

## Act 1

**Ellen**: I don't believe it!

**Philip**: What's wrong?

**Ellen**: Carter Boswell!

**Philip**: Who's Carter Boswell?

**Ellen**: He's running for the school board. The election's next month.

**Philip**: What's wrong with wanting to be on the school board?

**Ellen**: Nothing. But he wants to cut the school budget!

**Philip**: Maybe it needs cutting.

**Ellen**: Cutting the budget is fine, but he wants to do it by cutting all the cultural programs. No music, no dance, no concert, no stage presentations.

**Philip**: Why does he want to do that?

**Ellen**: He says it's to save the taxpayers' money, and I think he believes that the taxpayers will vote for him if he spends less on the cultural programs.

**Philip**: He's probably right. Lots of people want their taxes used for new books and a new paint job in the schoolrooms.

**Ellen**: Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more and keep the cultural programs for our kids.

**Philip**: Well, I'm not sure, Ellen. I hear it from my patients. Lots of people are tired of higher taxes.

**Ellen**: I know, but if Boswell wins he'll be an important decision-maker on the school board, and he doesn't know anything about our children's education.

**Philip**: Who's running against him?

**Ellen**: Nobody. That's the problem.

**Philip**: Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell is going to win this seat on the board.

**Ellen**: Oh, not if I can stop him!

**Philip**: And how are you going to stop him?

**Ellen**: I don't know. Maybe I'll run against him.

**Philip**: Well, you've got my vote.

**Ellen**: I'm serious, Philip. Why shouldn't I run?

**Robbie**: Why shouldn't you run for what, Mom?

**Philip**: Your mother is thinking of running for the school board.

**Robbie**: Hey, that's terrific, Mom!

**Richard**: Against Carter Boswell? Great!

**Ellen**: Well, if I run for office, the voters will have a clear choice. I stand for everything Boswell doesn't.

**Marilyn**: I think a lot of people will vote for you against Boswell, Ellen. I'll vote for you.

**Ellen**: Will you help me if I do run?

**Marilyn**: Absolutely.

**Ellen**: The trouble is it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign.

**Philip**: I think you can make a difference, Ellen. And in a short campaign you wouldn't need as much money. You know something, Ellen? Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice? I'm with you. You can make a difference.

**Maxwell**: Come in.

**Ellen**: Mr. Maxwell?

**Maxwell**: Yes, Charles Maxwell.

**Ellen**: My name is Ellen Stewart.

**Maxwell**: Hello. Please, sit down. You asked to see me. What would you like to see me about?

**Ellen**: I'd like your help.

**Maxwell**: Well, I'm editor of the most influential newspaper in Riverdale. Actually, it's the only newspaper. A lot of people would like my help. Do you have a story?

**Ellen**: I'm planning to run for the school board.

**Maxwell**: Against Carter Boswell?

**Ellen**: Yes.

**Maxwell**: Well, that is news.

**Ellen**: Will you announce that I'm running?

**Maxwell**: Sure. But I need some information.

**Ellen**: Of course.

**Maxwell**: Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell, Mrs. Stewart?

**Ellen**: Because I care.

**Maxwell**: "Vote for Ellen Stewart. She cares." Not a bad slogan. But what do you care about?

**Ellen**: Well, I care about the children of our town. I don't want them to grow up without cultural programs in our school.

**Maxwell**: Do you have a plan?

**Ellen**: I want our children to learn more than reading, writing, and arithmetic. I want to keep the after-school programs—the music, the concerts.

**Maxwell**: It's not a bad plan. But who's going to pay for all of this?

**Ellen**: We are. The citizens of Riverdale, of course. I plan to get help from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale.

**Maxwell**: That's fair enough. Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs. Stewart?

**Ellen**: You don't know me. I can't expect you to take my side against Boswell. But I do need some publicity so that the people of our town know that I'm running for office and that I care about our children.

**Maxwell**: Fair enough. I certainly can print the news. And you are now making news.

## Act 2

**Grandpa**: Here are the fliers, hot off the press!

**Ellen**: Looks good. Simple.

**Marilyn**: Right over there, Grandpa. You fold the fliers, Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.

**Richard**: We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.

**Grandpa**: Need another box?

**Ellen**: Good work, gang.

**Mike**: Hi, this is Mike Johnson. Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Anderson? Thanks.

**Robbie**: Mr. Nelson. Hi. This is Robbie Stewart. Did you know my mother is running for the school board?

**Jimmy**: Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart. "She cares." Oh, see you at the polls.

**Robbie**: Certainly, I'll give her your best wishes, Mr. Nelson.

**Mike**: Hi, this is Mike Johnson. Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Burns? Thank you.

**Ellen**: We have done so much in such a short amount of time. I can't believe it! Wait till Philip comes and sees our progress!

**Robbie**: Everyone saw the story in the Riverdale newspaper.

**Ellen**: Mr. Maxwell was very kind to print my announcement.

**Grandpa**: It helps enormously. Everybody in Riverdale reads his paper.

**Richard**: Your photo in it helped, too.

**Ellen**: Thanks to you, Richard, it's a good picture.

**Philip**: Well, hi, all.

**Richard** & Robbie: Hi, Dad.

**Ellen**: Hello, darling.

**Philip**: May I... may I help?

**Marilyn**: Licking envelopes.

**Grandpa**: I fold the fliers.

**Richard**: We stuff them.

**Philip**: And I lick the envelopes.

**Robbie**: Hey, everybody, Mrs. Greenberg is on the phone. She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now—doing a commercial.

**Philip**: What channel?

**Robbie**: Five.

**Philip**: Five?

**Boswell**: ...and if you ask what I care about, I'll tell you. I care about the school buildings in need of paint. I care about more lockers for the teachers. I care about new fixtures in the hallways—not music or dancing or entertainment. I care about the practical things. If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.

**Ellen**: A lot of people will agree with him.

**Philip**: I told you.

**Robbie**: Too bad kids can't vote. It's our school, but we can't vote.

**Richard**: There are people in favor of the cultural programs, Mom.

**Marilyn**: There are, Ellen. Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial.

**Philip**: You have to go on television, too.

**Ellen**: Boswell's a powerful speaker.

**Philip**: You can be, too. Your ideas are good ones.

**Ellen**: I don't know. I'm not sure I'm up to it.

## Act 3

**Ellen**: ...my slogan is "I care". I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care. How was it?

**Richard**: You were terrific!

**Ellen**: Can I see it?

**Richard**: Sure.

**Ellen**: Hello. My name is Ellen Stewart, and I'm running for the open seat on the school board. My slogan is "I care". What does the word care mean?... I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care.

**Philip**: I like it, but now what? How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale will see it and hear it?

**Richard**: Leave it to me.

**Ellen**: ...I mean that when I say "I care". I care about people, not things. Vote for me, Ellen Stewart. I care.

**Marilyn**: What happened?

**Richard**: Mom is now on television in every appliance store in Riverdale, except Hamlin's. He's a Boswell voter.

**Philip**: That's a brilliant idea, Richard!

**Grandpa**: You inherited your father's brains.

**Philip**: We got our brains from you, Dad.

**Richard**: And guess what? I called channel five. Their TV news is going to cover it. "Housewife campaigns in appliance stores." And I'll bet some magazine will pick up the story, too.

**Robbie**: Mom, you're going to win! I know it!

**Philip**: Hold it, Robbie! Just cool down. I know we're getting some attention now, but in the end the voters will have to decide.

**Grandpa**: You're going to win. Trust me!

**Reporter**: In the hotly contested race for the one seat on the Riverdale School Board, Mrs. Ellen Stewart has taken an early lead.

**Robbie**: She's winning! Mom, you're winning!

**Reporter**: Now returning to other local news... Riverdale High School beat its rival Horace Mann in baseball today...

**Ellen**: It's too soon to know for certain.

**Philip**: You're ahead. That's better than being behind.

**Reporter**: More sports after this.

**Ellen**: It's not over yet. Let's just all calm down, and wait for the final results.

**Grandpa**: Ellen, why don't you go out to the backyard and get some fresh air?

**Ellen**: Thank you, Grandpa. I need some.

**Ellen**: What happened?

**Philip**: You came very close, Ellen.

**Grandpa**: You lost by only a hundred and twenty-one votes.

**Ellen**: I lost.

**Richard**: You tried, Mom.

**Marilyn**: You lost by a very small number of votes.

**Robbie**: Only one hundred and twenty-one votes! I'm sorry, Mom.

**Ellen**: There just wasn't enough time.

**Philip**: Look, you've made a very strong impression on our community. You'll have another chance next election.

**Philip**: Hello. Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Maxwell.

**Ellen**: Hello, Mr. Maxwell.

**Maxwell**: How are you? I just called to tell you that you are very impressive. You lost the election, but you won the attention of the residents of Riverdale, of Boswell, and of me.

**Ellen**: Well, thank you, Mr. Maxwell. I appreciate your kind words. I needed that.

**Maxwell**: I hear Boswell wants to appoint you to a special arts committee. I'm sending over a reporter in the morning to interview you.

**Ellen**: You are?

**Maxwell**: I'm going to do an article on "Ellen Stewart—she cares." Maybe we'll all care now. Good-bye.

**Ellen**: Thank you—and good-bye.

**Philip**: What was that about?

**Ellen**: You were right, Philip. I did make a difference in town.

**Robbie**: And in this family.
