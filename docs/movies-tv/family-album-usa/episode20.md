# Quality Time

## Act 1

**Robbie**: Where's Mom?

**Grandpa**: She went to a school-board meeting.

**Robbie**: I don't know how she does it. She sure keeps busy.

**Grandpa**: It's important to her. There are lots of places to go, lots of things to do. She can't sit around and do nothing. Philip works late.

**Robbie**: I guess you're right. I wish I had her energy.

**Philip**: Anybody home?

**Robbie**: We're in here, Dad.

**Philip**: Oh. Hi, gang.

**Grandpa**: Hello, Philip. How was your day?

**Philip**: My day was just fine. So was my night. It's almost ten o'clock. Mmm. I'm starving. Um...where's Mom?

**Robbie**: She went to a school-board meeting.

**Grandpa**: There's a note for you on the refrigerator.

**Philip**: Oh?

**Philip**: Did you have dinner, Robbie?

**Robbie**: Yeah. Mike and I had a hamburger at the diner. I came home a little while ago. You've been working late almost every night this week, Dad. Aren't you exhausted?

**Philip**: I don't have time to be exhausted.

**Robbie**: You and Mom haven't had dinner together with us in almost a full week.

**Philip**: Yeah, I feel bad about us not having dinner with the family, but our schedules are so different. Either I'm at the hospital doing paperwork, or Mom is at a committee meeting. I frankly don't know what to do about it.

**Robbie**: I'm worried about you and Mom. You really have been working too hard.

**Philip**: Well, I think I've had enough of that sandwich.

**Robbie**: You didn't finish it.

**Philip**: It's not good to eat before going to bed. A cookie can't hurt, though.

**Philip**: Well, I'm heading off for bed and a good night's sleep.

**Robbie**: Well, good night.

**Philip**: Good night, son. Good night, Dad. I'm going to bed.

**Grandpa**: Good night, Philip.

**Philip**: Haven't you finished balancing that checkbook?

**Grandpa**: I found another mistake. I'll be off to bed myself in a minute.

**Philip**: OK. Good night.

**Robbie**: I'm really concerned about them, Grandpa.

**Grandpa**: Concerned about whom?

**Robbie**: About Mom and Dad. They hardly ever see each other. Dad often works late, and Mom has all these committees she's on.

**Grandpa**: What do you propose to do about it? You have that look in your eye.

**Robbie**: I don't know, but there must be a way of getting them to spend more time together. Quality time.

## Act 2

**Ellen**: Hello there, Robbie. What are you doing up this late?

**Robbie**: Reading.

**Ellen**: Reading? At this hour? Ah, come on, Robbie. What are you doing up this late?

**Robbie**: Things on my mind.

**Ellen**: Do you care to talk about them?

**Robbie**: Sure, if you don't mind listening.

**Ellen**: Robbie, Robbie, remember me? I'm your mother. If you have something you want to talk about, I'm always prepared to listen.

**Robbie**: You haven't been around much lately.

**Ellen**: So that's it. OK, let's talk.

**Robbie**: You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night. Dad works hard, and he works late. You work hard on all your committees, and you work late.

**Ellen**: I thought you were proud of the work I do.

**Robbie**: I am, Mom. Real proud. You are one fantastic mom, but...but I've been noticing how little quality time you spend with Dad and me... and the family.

**Ellen**: It's a real problem, Robbie. I know it.

**Robbie**: I'm concerned. There must be a way that Dad and you can spend more time together.

**Ellen**: Well, we always talk about taking a vacation together with the family.

**Robbie**: I think you ought to take a vacation away from the family-alone. Kind of a second honeymoon.

**Ellen**: It would be wonderful, but our schedules won't allow it.

**Robbie**: I think I have an idea.

**Ellen**: You do?

**Robbie**: Yup. I think I have an idea that will bring Dad and you together in a more scheduled way.

**Ellen**: What is it?

**Robbie**: Well, you know how Dad is always talking about the kids in the ward and how important it is for them to be paid attention to?

**Ellen**: Yes.

**Robbie**: Well...and how hard it is because the doctors and nurses are so busy?

**Ellen**: Yes.

**Robbie**: Well, how would it be if you took some time to work with Dad towards solving that problem?

**Ellen**: I don't get it.

**Robbie**: Like setting up a regular weekly reading program. You and Dad. You and Dr. Philip Stewart-going to the children's ward once or twice a week and reading to them.

**Ellen**: Not bad. Not a bad idea, Robbie. As a matter of fact, it fits right in with something I'm working on right now with the school-board committee.

**Robbie**: What's that?

**Ellen**: I've been trying to work out a program in the public school that will bring parents and teachers together once a week to read to the students-their own children, really. By doing that, it will encourage reading.

**Robbie**: So it might fit in with a program for reading to the kids in the hospital.

**Ellen**: You're right. We'll do it! I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now.

**Robbie**: But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work. Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow?

**Ellen**: You are a very smart young man, Robbie. I think I'll wait until tomorrow.

**Robbie**: You won't forget, will you?

**Ellen**: Believe me, I won't. It is a great idea, and I promise you I won't forget.

**Robbie**: Thanks, Mom.

**Ellen**: Thank you, Robbie.

## Act 3

**Ellen**: Good morning. What a wonderful morning! Don't the flowers smell wonderful?

**Philip**: Good morning, Ellen. Yes, they do. That's why I'm reading my paper and having my coffee on the patio this morning. Ah, it does smell sweet. How was your school-board meeting last night? You must've come home very late.

**Ellen**: Did you find the sandwich I made for you?

**Philip**: Thanks, dear. I was so tired I didn't even finish it.

**Ellen**: Philip, I've been working on this special project with the school board, and I'd like your opinion about it.

**Philip**: What is it?

**Ellen**: I've been trying to find a way to encourage reading.

**Philip**: Good luck!

**Ellen**: Well, I think I may have found a way to do it.

**Philip**: Tell me about it. I work with families every day, Ellen. I see how people spend their leisure time-young and old.

**Ellen**: Mostly watching television. Well, that would be OK if, and I repeat, if people took the time to read.

**Philip**: I couldn't agree with you more.

**Ellen**: The question is, how do we get them to read more?

**Philip**: I think you're going to give me the answer to that question. You have that look in your eye.

**Ellen**: I do have an answer, Philip. Or at least I think I do.

**Philip**: Well, tell me about it.

**Ellen**: The plan is a simple one. Involve the entire family in a reading project.

**Philip**: In the home?

**Ellen**: Yes, in the home. But first in the school-rooms.

**Philip**: Hmm, interesting. But how do you plan to do that?

**Ellen**: By arranging with the public schools to schedule one hour a week-to start with. During that time parents are invited to attend-and to read along with the children- their children.

**Philip**: It can go beyond the school system, Ellen.

**Ellen**: Really?

**Philip**: I guarantee you it would go very well in the hospitals. My patients-mostly kids-would love to read and be read to.

**Ellen**: You think so?

**Philip**: I know so.

**Ellen**: Maybe we can experiment with your patients and see how the plan works.

**Philip**: I love the idea. Would you work with me?

**Ellen**: I would love to, Philip.

**Philip**: And that way, we'll spend more time together, Ellen. We just don't see each other anymore.

**Ellen**: You and I are very busy these days. This is true. We need to find time to be together more, to do things together more-you and I. This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that.

**Philip**: I have a question.

**Ellen**: Yes?

**Philip**: What do we read?

**Ellen**: To the patients in the ward?

**Philip**: Yes.

**Ellen**: Well, let you and I talk about it. What would you like to read to them?

**Philip**: Mrs. Stewart and I will read a poem by Robert Frost.

**Ellen**: It's called "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening."

**Philip**: Would you begin, Ellen?

**Ellen**: All right. "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" by Robert Frost. Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow.

**Philip**: My little horse must think it queer. To stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake. The darkest evening of the year.

**Ellen**: He gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake.

**Ellen** & Philip: The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.

**Grandpa**: You two belong on stage! That was wonderful!

**Ellen**: Grandpa!

**Philip**: Dad...Robbie. When did you come?

**Grandpa**: We've been listening to you both. These are lucky kids.

**Robbie**: Do you enjoy reading together?

**Philip**: Well, we may read together aloud at home.

**Grandpa**: You were right, Robbie.

**Robbie**: I know.
