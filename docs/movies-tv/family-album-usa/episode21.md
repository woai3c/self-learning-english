# A Big Fish in a Little Pond

## Act 1

**Michelle**: I really like this one, Susan. Do you?

**Susan**: Turn around, Michelle. Let me see the back of it. I like it a lot. It fits well. It doesn't need any alterations. We must've bought the right size.

**Harry**: I like the color. She looks good in blue.

**Michelle**: I like blue, too, Daddy.

**Susan**: Try on the skirt and blouse outfit, Michelle—the one that Daddy wanted you to wear.

**Michelle**: OK.

**Harry**: Michelle has been a different kid since we've been married. She's never been happier.

**Susan**: And I've never been happier, Harry. I love her very much. She's been a joy.

**Harry**: We're very lucky, the three of us...and becoming part of the Stewart family, too.

**Susan**: We couldn't ask for anything more, could we?

**Harry**: Well...

**Susan**: Well...? Could we ask for anything more?

**Harry**: Well...we...

**Michelle**: How do you like it, Daddy?

**Harry**: It's my favorite outfit.

**Susan**: It's good for every day. It will be good for school, Michelle.

**Michelle**: I like it, too. I always like skirts that go like this. Do you want to see the winter jacket on me, Susan?

**Susan**: Yes, I do. Change back into your jeans, and put on the new winter jacket we bought today.

**Michelle**: OK.

**Susan**: What did you mean by "well...?" You had something on your mind when I said we couldn't ask for anything more.

**Michelle**: Is everything all right?

**Harry**: Everything is fine, Michelle.

**Susan**: Let's take a look at the winter jacket. Come on over here, Honey.

**Michelle**: It's kind of warm.

**Susan**: It is. That's why we bought it for you. This will be a perfect jacket for the wintertime when it's very cold out. But it's kind of small also. We must've bought the wrong size.

**Harry**: Looks like we should've bought a bigger one. I guess we'll have to exchange it, too. I'm sure the store has others.

**Michelle**: I look silly! It is too small!

**Susan**: You're growing so fast, Michelle.

**Michelle**: Can I take it off? I'm hot!

**Susan**: Sure. Put it back in your room, and we'll hang everything up later.

**Susan**: Well, are you going to tell me what's on your mind, Harry?

**Harry**: I have been offered a job with a major accounting company in Los Angeles.

**Susan**: Los Angeles? That's a big decision.

**Harry**: I know. It will also affect you and your job, if we decide to go.

**Susan**: Wow! It sure will. But first tell me about the job, Harry. If it's a good one, then we'll make it work for us.

**Harry**: I have a client in the garment business, on Seventh Avenue. I do his taxes every year. He has a big sales office in Los Angeles, and the company in Los Angeles that does his major accounting work is looking for an executive. And he recommended me.

**Susan**: That's wonderful, Harry.

**Harry**: Yes, but it would mean that we'd have to move to L.A.

**Susan**: What about the salary?

**Harry**: The real discussion comes tomorrow. Susan, I don't plan to make any decisions until I have a chance to talk with you about it.

**Susan**: I understand, Harry.

**Harry**: And I don't have to make a quick decision. They know that I'm married and that I have a family.

**Susan**: Well, there's a lot to think about. If it's a good job, then I've got to do some thinking about my career opportunities in Los Angeles.

**Michelle**: Is everything OK?

**Susan**: Yes, honey.

## Act 2

**Grandpa**: Hello. Hello there. Are you ready for lunch with your grandpa?

**Susan**: Oh! Hi, Grandpa. Yes, of course, I am, but my mind isn't.

**Grandpa**: What's the matter, Susan?

**Susan**: A real dilemma.

**Grandpa**: Does it have anything to do with you and Harry?

**Susan**: Yes, but I don't know where to start.

**Grandpa**: Maybe I can help. Tell me what it is, Susan.

**Susan**: Thanks, Grandpa. Please sit down. Oh! Harry has been offered a job in Los Angeles.

**Grandpa**: Well, this is something to think about.

**Susan**: There are so many things to consider. There's Michelle. I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her. And my job. I don't know if I can get a good job in Los Angeles. And what about our family?

**Grandpa**: Can I tell you what I think?

**Susan**: Tell me.

**Grandpa**: I think that you're very successful and that you have a fantastic reputation in the toy industry. I think you could talk to Mr. Marchetta, and I think he could help you find a really good job in Los Angeles. He was very helpful to me, remember?

**Susan**: I suppose I could call him. But I'm not so sure that I want to leave New York, you, and the rest of our family.

**Grandpa**: Well, I'm not going to kid you, Susan. You know we'd all miss you. But this should be your decision. It's something that only you and Harry can work out.

**Susan**: If moving to L.A. is in Harry's best interest, I have to do what I can do to support him.

**Grandpa**: In every marriage, sacrifices have to be made by one partner from time to time.

**Susan**: And what about Michelle?

**Grandpa**: Well, what do you think?

**Susan**: I think Michelle is better off staying where she is.

**Grandpa**: What does she think?

**Susan**: I don't know for sure.

**Grandpa**: Well, you'll have to ask her.

**Susan**: I think I'm going to have a talk with Mr. Marchetta and get his feelings about my leaving. And about helping me find a job in Los Angeles.

**Grandpa**: Good idea.

**Susan**: I'll call him right now. No point in delaying. Thanks, Grandpa.

**Bill**: Harry, it's the perfect job for you. You'll love it.

**Harry**: It's a big decision for me, Bill. And I have to discuss it with my wife. I don't know if it's right for her.

**Bill**: She'll love it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime offer, Harry.

**Harry**: OK. Tell it to me again.

**Bill**: The company is Craft and Craft, the biggest accounting company in the country.

**Harry**: I know the company well. It's big.

**Bill**: The biggest.

**Harry**: Yeah, yeah. The biggest. When do I have to let you know?

**Bill**: Talk it over. Think it over. Let me know by the end of the week.

**Harry**: When would we have to move?

**Bill**: As soon as possible.

**Harry**: I also have my daughter to consider. I don't want to interrupt her school year.

**Bill**: Let me know by the end of the week. It's a great opportunity for you, Harry. Believe me.

**Harry**: I know.

**Bill**: Craft and Craft is the biggest in the country.

**Harry**: Yeah, I know. The biggest.

**Susan**: I think Michelle is asleep now. Let's talk.

**Harry**: I met with Bill York today.

**Susan**: And I talked with Mr. Marchetta. Did York make the offer?

**Harry**: Yup. He asked me if I want the job.

**Susan**: That's exciting, Harry. What was it?

**Harry**: A vice-presidency with the biggest accounting company in the country—Craft and Craft.

**Susan**: Aren't you excited about that?

**Harry**: Sure I am. But there's so much more to consider.

**Susan**: I talked to Mr. Marchetta.

**Harry**: What did he say? Did you tell him about me?

**Susan**: Of course, Harry. I want what's best for you, and I think I can get a good job through Mr. Marchetta in Los Angeles also.

**Harry**: You're kidding.

**Susan**: No, I'm not kidding. I talked with him, and he understands completely. He has a major toy buyer in Los Angeles, and he's pretty sure that I can get a good job there.

**Harry**: Unbelievable!

**Susan**: But I think we should talk to Michelle about all of this.

**Harry**: You're right. We'll talk to her about it.

**Susan**: And how do you feel about taking the job in Los Angeles?

**Harry**: How should I feel? It's the biggest company in the country.

**Susan**: Well, then you feel good about taking it?

**Harry**: Well... I feel fine about it. Why shouldn't I?

## Act 3

**Michelle**: I love my school. I have so many good friends there now. I wouldn't miss a day even if I were really sick.

**Susan**: Come and sit down for a minute, Michelle. I'd like to talk to you about something. Something important.

**Michelle**: What's wrong, Susan?

**Susan**: Oh, there's nothing wrong, Michelle. But your daddy and I are talking about something that I'd like your opinion about.

**Michelle**: I know. I heard you talking about it the other night when I was trying on my new clothes. It's about moving to Los Angeles.

**Susan**: You're right. How do you feel about it?

**Michelle**: Well, I really wouldn't want to move, but...

**Susan**: But?

**Michelle**: But if you and Daddy wanted to, I guess you know what's best for the family and for me.

**Susan**: That's very considerate of you, Michelle. But what about your friends?

**Michelle**: I'd miss them a lot, but I know what it feels like to miss someone.

**Susan**: Honey, we don't have to move if you're not going to be happy about it.

**Michelle**: Does Daddy want to move?

**Susan**: I think so. He's going to tell us tonight about the job offer.

**Harry**: Well, how was everybody's day today?

**Susan**: Michelle was chosen to do the school poster for the play this year.

**Harry**: Congratulations, Michelle! That's something! And how was your day, Susan?

**Susan**: I see you're in a good mood. Why don't you tell us about your day.

**Harry**: I met with Bill York.

**Susan**: It's OK to talk about it, Harry. Michelle knows all about it.

**Harry**: Really?

**Susan**: Really, Harry. Michelle and I have all kinds of feelings about leaving New York, the family, and friends. But if you think you should take the job, we're behind you.

**Harry**: What about Michelle's school?

**Susan**: We'll move after the school term.

**Harry**: What about her new friends?

**Michelle**: I'll make new friends wherever we are as long as we're together.

**Susan**: We're a family, Harry. Whatever you think is right for you is right for us.

**Harry**: I am so touched. The two of you are really something.

**Michelle**: We love you, Daddy.

**Harry**: And I love you.

**Susan**: OK. Now, tell us about your talk with Mr. York. Did you take the job?

**Harry**: Nope.

**Michelle**: What?

**Susan**: No? You didn't take it?

**Harry**: No, I did not take the job.

**Michelle**: But, Daddy, I thought...

**Susan**: Harry, you didn't turn it down because of me...

**Michelle**: Or me?

**Harry**: No, no. I turned it down because of me.

**Susan**: How's that?

**Harry**: Well, I began to think about you and about Michelle, and then I asked myself, do I really want to work for the biggest company in the country?

**Susan**: And?

**Harry**: And I don't. I went into business for myself because I like being my own boss. I run my own company. I'm a big fish in a little pond. I'm not really sure I want to be a little fish in a big pond.

**Michelle**: Oh, Daddy, does that mean we don't have to move?

**Harry**: That's right, sweetheart.

**Susan**: Are you sure?

**Harry**: I couldn't be more sure, Susan.

**Susan**: I'm glad if you are, Harry.

**Harry**: And besides, how could I live in Los Angeles when all my favorite people live here?

**Susan**: Your favorite people?

**Michelle**: Who's that?

**Harry**: The Stewart family, of course.
