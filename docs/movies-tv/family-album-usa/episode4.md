# A Piece of Cake

## Act 1

**Marilyn**: I'm exhausted. My new exercise class is so hard.

**Richard**: Your new exercise class?

**Marilyn**: Yeah. My new advanced exercise class.

**Richard**: Why advanced?

**Marilyn**: My instructor thought that the beginner's class was too easy for me.

**Richard**: Too easy for you?

**Marilyn**: Don't laugh. In the beginner's class, they give you a chance to rest between exercises.

**Richard**: So?

**Marilyn**: The advanced class is nonstop.

**Richard**: I lift weights every morning for sixty minutes without stopping. No problem.

**Marilyn**: Listen, Richard, doing aerobics for an hour is a lot different than lifting weights.

**Richard**: Yeah.Quite a bit different.I think aerobics is easy. I could work out in your class with no problem.

**Marilyn**: You think so?

**Richard**: Oh, without a doubt. When's the next class?

**Marilyn**: Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. Try it.

**Richard**: Tomorrow morning after lifting weights, I'll try aerobics. It's a snap. Tomorrow morning at ten oâ€™clock.

**Marilyn**: Aren't you going to the aerobics class this morning?

**Richard**: Of course. Easy. No sweat.

**Marilyn**: You are not going to be able to move after this and the aerobics class.

**Richard**: Are you kidding me? It's going to be a piece of cake. You want to bet.

**Marilyn**: Yeah. What's the bet?

**Richard**: I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing!

**Marilyn**: The bet is-I win, and you cook dinner for the entire family. Or you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.

**Richard**: It's a bet.

**Marilyn**: OK. Call my instructor, Jack Davis, right now. His number is 555-8842.The advanced class starts at ten o'clock.
