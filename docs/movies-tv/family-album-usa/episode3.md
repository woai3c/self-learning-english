# Grandpa's Trunk

## Act 1

**Ellen**: Marilyn, you want coffee or tea?

**Marilyn**: Coffee, please.

**Ellen**: I am so excited! At this time tomorrow morning, Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.

**Marilyn**: When does he arrive?

**Ellen**: At six o'clock this evening.

**Marilyn**: By plane?

**Ellen**: No, by train.

**Marilyn**: Are we picking him up at the station?

**Ellen**: Not Grandpa. He doesn't want anybody picking him up. He likes to be independent.

**Marilyn**: Huh.

**Ellen**: Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.

**Marilyn**: Great! Let's do it!

**Richard**: Good morning, Mom.

**Robbie**: Morning.

**Ellen**: Well, hi,fellas.

**Richard**: Hello.

**Marilyn**: Hi,honey.

**Richard**: Hi, honey.

**Robbie**: Morning, Marilyn.

**Marilyn**: We're going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room. There's coffee ready.

**Robbie**: I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.

**Richard**: Me, too. Milk, please.

**Robbie**: He's so funny. He always makes me laugh. I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.

**Richard**: I think he will. It just takes time to fell comfortable in a new place.

**Robbie**: Won't he miss being in Florida?

**Richard**: Will, he will. But I think he'll like being here with the family.

**Robbie**: Are you sure about that? It's crazy here most of the time.

**Richard**: But it's fun.

**Robbie**: That's for sure.

**Richard**: You know, maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa as a "welcome" present.

**Robbie**: That's a neat idea. What can I do ? I've got it! I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet. It's from the Father's and Son's Breakfast at my junior high school graduation.

**Richard**: Oh, I remember this picture.

**Robbie**: I'd really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.

**Richard**: Railroad stations or airports-Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.

**Robbie**: He's something!

**Marilyn**: Is this all Grandpa's stuff?

**Ellen**: That's it. But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.

**Marilyn**: What's inside?

**Ellen**: I don't know. It's locked.

**Philip**: Hi.

**Ellen**: Oh, hi, darling.

**Marilyn**: Morning, Philip.

**Philip**: I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet. You know I'm very excited about his arrival.

**Ellen**: We are, too.Susan called early this morning. She's unhappy and can't leave till tonight. She wants to be here for Grandpa.

**Philip**: Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too. He loves Susan.She always reminds him of Grandma. Well,how's everything here?

**Marilyn**: Fine.We were just wondering about this trunk.

**Ellen**: It's locked.

**Philip**: Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.

**Grandpa**: No, it's not taken.

**Elsa**: Oh, thank you.

**Grandpa**: Do you live in New York?

**Elsa**: No,no.I'm from Florida.

**Elsa**: No,no.I just changed my seat. A man next to me was smoking, and smoke really bothers me .Where are you from in Florida?

**Grandpa**: Titusville.It's near Orlando.

**Elsa**: Small world. I'm from Titusville,too.

**Grandpa**: Really? What part?

**Elsa**: My husband and I live near Spaceport.

**Grandpa**: I know that area. My house is only a few miles from Spaceport. Do you still live there?

**Elsa**: Oh yes, yes.My husband's there now. He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me. Do you still live there?

**Grandpa**: No.I sold the house and the furniture, put a few personal things in an old trunk, and shipped it to my children in New York. That's my destination.

**Elsa**: Are you married?

**Grandpa**: My wife died four years ago.She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.

**Elsa**: I'm sorry.Really, I'm sorry.

**Grandpa**: Lots of wonderful memories. We were married almost fifty years.Well, forty-seven, to be exact.

**Elsa**: John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.

**Grandpa**: Oh, congratulation! That's nice. What does John do?

**Elsa**: He's an aerospace engineer and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.He started with them almost forty years ago. What do you do?

**Grandpa**: I just retired. Had my own company. A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff. But I just sold it and retired.

**Conductor**: Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket,please.

**Elsa**: Would you kindly hold these keys, please? I have a ticket, I know. I was in the smoking section.

**Conductor**: It's OK, lady. Take your time.

**Grandpa**: I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs.Tobin.

**Elsa**: Oh,here it is.

**Grandpa**: And here are your keys.

**Elsa**: Thank you.

**Grandpa**: Do you have family in New York?

**Elsa**: No, no.But do have very close friends in New York City. We like to go to the theatre together. You said you have family in New York.

**Grandpa**: Yes,indeed. A son and his wife and their three children-my grandchildren.

**Elsa**: You must be excited.

**Grandpa**: I can't wait, to see them!

**Elsa**: Are you going to live with them?

**Grandpa**: Yes.

**Elsa**: Permanently?

**Grandpa**: Well...they want me to, but it's too early to know for sure. I'm pretty independent. I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence, but I'm not sure I want to be alone. Some people don't mind being alone.I do.

**Elsa**: I understand. But tell me. Why did you stop working?

**Grandpa**: I retired because... I wanted to be with my family. I didn't want to be alone anymore!
